The main application is located in the bokeh_app folder. 

To run the application, open a command prompt, change to the directory containing bokeh_app 

run bokeh serve --show bokeh_app/. 

This runs a bokeh server locally and will automatically open the interactive dashboard in your browser at localhost:5006.
